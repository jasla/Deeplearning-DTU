# Deeplearning-DTU
Deep Sparse Non-Negative Neural Network for Raman Spectroscopy 
trained using a parts based approach with a Sparse Non-Negative Auto Encoder

The datasets are located in `data\`. Unzip them before running any scripts.

## Jupyter

A version of the autoencoder have been created in jupyter. See `MNIST_run.ipynb` and `raman_run.ipynb`

## Regular python (spyder)

The primary development have been done in spyder. See the scripts `raman_run.py` and `MNIST_run.py` for Spyder based (the use of cells) scripts.
