abstract = {Previous work has shown that the difficul-ties in learning deep generative or discrim-inative models can be overcome by an ini-tial unsupervised learning step that maps in-puts to useful intermediate representations. We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a rep-resentation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial cor-ruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to ini-tialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising ad-vantage of corrupting the input of autoen-coders on a pattern classification benchmark suite.},

abstract = {A broadly applicable algorithm for computing maximum likelihood estimates from incomplete data is presented at various levels of generality. Theory showing the monotone behaviour of the likelihood and convergence of the algorithm is derived. Many examples are sketched, including missing value situations, applications to grouped, censored or truncated data, finite mixture models, variance component estimation, hyperparameter estimation, iteratively reweighted least squares and factor analysis.},
